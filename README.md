## ðŸ“¦ Multi-Environment Support

This project supports **multiple environments**:

- `.env.development`
- `.env.uat`
- `.env.production`

### Tools Used

- âœ… `react-native-config` for managing `.env` files
- âœ… Android Product Flavors
- âœ… iOS Xcode Schemes
- âœ… Dynamic App Names per environment

### How It Works

1. Create `.env` files:
   ```sh
   .env.development
   .env.uat
   .env.production


   ```
2. Use the correct environment file when building or running the app.
